# Wizardry School Enrollment
##### Machine Learning I - Data Science Degree - NOVA IMS

### Project Description
In the mystical world of wizardry, aspiring enchanters seek admission to the most prestigious wizardry schools, known for unlocking their hidden magical potential. The doors to these hallowed halls are open only to those deemed worthy. This project aims to discern, with precision, who among these aspiring enchanters shall earn the privilege of entering the world of wizardry. Our quest delves into their qualifications, backgrounds, and unique magical potential, determining who shall walk through the gates of wisdom and power.

#### Objective:
The objective is to develop a predictive model using a training set, leveraging the qualifications and magical potential of aspiring students. This model will accurately predict which students are suitable for enrollment in wizardry schools. It ensures that only the most deserving candidates gain admission to the realm of magical education. The modeling is limited to the sklearn library only.

#### Data Description
The dataset offers a comprehensive overview of students admitted to magical schools, capturing key attributes such as their program of study, gender, experience level, family background, and preferred study element. With 889 observations, this dataset provides a valuable resource for exploring patterns and trends in student admissions within the magical education domain. 

*Note: The data was divided a priori in two csv files: train and test datasets.*

### Repository Description
This repository contains all the files created during the development of our project. In the following paragraphs will be a short description of how the repository is organized and what each file contains:
- [Notebook](notebook.ipynb): file that contains the project's main code and the outputs that are fundamental to our decision-making in the development of the work.
- [Utils](utils.py): py file that contains the functions needed for the main code to work, so the code is more optimized and generalizable.
- [Data folder](data): folder that contains the 2 csvs with the data used in the project.
- [Report](Report.pdf): academic report of the project, containing the methodology used in the work and the conclusions drawn.
- [Metadata](metadata.txt): text file that contains the metadata of all the used data in our project.
- [README](README.md): (this) file that contains the project and the repository descriptions.

### Possible Improvements
While the current project has laid a solid foundation for predicting student admissions to wizardry schools, several areas for improvement have been identified. Future iterations of this project could benefit from addressing the following issues:

1. Hyperparameter Tuning:
- The current implementation lacks an in-depth exploration of hyperparameter tuning. A more exhaustive search for optimal hyperparameters could be conducted to enhance model performance. Employing techniques such as grid search or randomized search would allow us to fine-tune the model and potentially improve predictive accuracy.

2. Enhanced Visualization and Tables:
- The results section of the report could be significantly enhanced by incorporating more visualizations and tables. Visual representations of key metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-Score, would provide a clearer understanding of the model's performance. Additionally, tables summarizing hyperparameter choices and their corresponding impact on performance would be valuable for readers seeking a detailed analysis.

3. Model Performance Improvement:
- Further efforts should be invested in exploring advanced modeling techniques and algorithms. Experimentation with ensemble methods, feature engineering, and the exploration of more complex models might yield improvements in predictive accuracy. Additionally, investigating potential interactions between features and incorporating them into the model could enhance its ability to capture nuanced patterns in the data.
